(This file must be manually downloaded. See below for instructions.)

To complete the Gradle wrapper setup, you need to download the official `gradle-wrapper.jar` from Gradle's distribution:

1. Download the file from:
   https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip

2. Unzip the archive and locate `gradle-wrapper.jar` under `gradle-8.5/bin/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`.

3. Place the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file in:
   `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` (relative to your project root)

This file is required for the wrapper scripts to function.

If you would like, I can provide you with the direct download link and step-by-step instructions. Once you have placed the file, you will be able to run `./gradlew build` with Gradle 8.5 and Java 21.
